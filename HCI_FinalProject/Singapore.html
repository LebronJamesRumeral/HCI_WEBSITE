            <h1>About Singapore</h1>
            <p class="text">
                Singapore is a sunny, tropical island in South-east Asia, off the
            southern tip of the Malay Peninsula. The city-state is 710 square
            kilometres and inhabited by five million people from four major
            communities; Chinese (majority), Malay, Indian and Eurasian. It
            consists of the diamond-shaped Singapore Island and some 60 small
            islets; the main island occupies all but about 18 square miles of
            this combined area. The main island is separated from Peninsular
            Malaysia to the north by Johor Strait, a narrow channel crossed by a
            road and rail causeway that is more than half a mile long. The
            southern limits of the state run through Singapore Strait, where
            outliers of the Riau-Lingga Archipelago—which forms a part of
            Indonesia—extend to within 10 miles of the main island. Ideally
            positioned in South-east Asia, where the rest of the region is just
            a hop, skip and jump away, Singapore is a thriving metropolis
            offering a world-class infrastructure, a fully integrated
            island-wide transport network, dynamic business environment, vibrant
            living spaces and a rich culture largely influenced by the four
            major communities in Singapore with each offering different
            perspective of life in Singapore in terms of culture, religion,
            food, language and history.

            <h1>Quick History</h1>
            <p class="text">
                Modern Singapore was founded in the 19th century, thanks to politics,
                trade and a man known as Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles. During this time,
                the British empire was eyeing a port of call in this region to base its merchant fleet, 
                and to forestall any advance made by the Dutch.
